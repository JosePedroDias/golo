# demos

* [latest experiment powered by the PC web editor](export_20140810/index.html)
* [ongoing refactoring](handmade/index.html)



# directory structure

* **export_20140810** holds the PlayCanvas exports from the web editor

* **handmade** holds my refactoring on the game (ongoing work)

I've [collected some notes](PLAYCANVAS_NOTES.md) on how to convert exported assets so they can be imperatively loaded



# TODOs

* extract additional entities from the old version (goals, player, script components, etc.)
