screencasts so far:

* [taming playcanvas               ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVQba4VGNsA)
* [football game prototype - part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHecVoHl7ec)



# demos

* [latest experiment powered by the PC web editor](http://josepedrodias.github.io/golo/export_20140810/index.html)
* [ongoing refactoring](http://josepedrodias.github.io/golo/handmade/index.html)

The demo uses keys WSAD to move, space to shoot.  
Shooting works only at close distance from ball and there's no feedback whatsoever apart from the ball getting the impulse.



# directory structure

* **export_20140810** holds the PlayCanvas exports from the web editor

* **handmade** holds my refactoring on the game (ongoing work)

I've [collected some notes](PLAYCANVAS_NOTES.md) on how to convert exported assets so they can be imperatively loaded



# TODOs

* extract additional entities from the old version (goals, player, script components, etc.)
